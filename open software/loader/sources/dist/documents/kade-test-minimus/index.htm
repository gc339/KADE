<h2>LED BLINK TEST</h2>
<p>This is a test firmware which will verify the three onboard LED’s (Blue, Red and Green) and the two onboard buttons (HWB and RESET).

You should program the KADE with this firmware and then connect it to a USB port.

A Successful test will give the following results.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The green LED will remain on at all times.</li>
  <li>The blue and red onboard LED’s will flash quickly.</li>
  <li>While HWB button is pressed the blue and red LED’s will remain on. No flashing. </li>
  <li>While RESET button is pressed the blue and red LED’s will remain off. No flashing. </li>
</ol>
<p>Right, so all being well, you are ready to check out some seriously cool firmware for your KADE.</p></body>
