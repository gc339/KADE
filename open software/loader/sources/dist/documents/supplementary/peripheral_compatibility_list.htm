<h2>Device Compatibility</h2>

The trackball pins on KADE are compatible with analog PS/2 devices including Trackball, Spinner and Mouse.
</br>
There is also good support for USB mouse devices (due to the backwards compatible with PS/2 protocol).
<br></br>
Here is a list of devices that have been successfully tested with KADE.
