<h2>LED BLINK TEST</h2>
<p>This is a test firmware which will verify the two onboard LED’s (Red and Green) and the single onboard reset button.  </p>
<p>To test, program the KADE with this firmware and connect to the device to a power supply or USB port.
  
  A Successful test will give the following results.  </p>
<ol>
  <li>The green LED will remain on at all times. </li>
  <li>The red onboard LED will flash quickly. </li>
  <li>While the reset button is pressed the red LED will remain off. </li>
</ol>
<p>Right, so all being well, you are ready to check out some seriously cool firmware for your KADE.</p>
